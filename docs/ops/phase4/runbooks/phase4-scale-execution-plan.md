# Phase 4 Scale Execution Plan

## Objective
Scale from pilot to controlled growth with KPI gates, policy guardrails, and measurable unit economics.

## Scope Mapping (Task.md)
1. Coverage zone expansion via KPI gates.
2. Delivery mode enablement for ready zones only.
3. Dynamic pricing rollout and governance.
4. Ranking weight experiments (A/B).
5. Growth module rollout (loyalty/referral/promo).
6. Advanced analytics (retention cohort + partner quality tiers).
7. Payout governance by partner risk profile.
8. Dispute triage automation and policy enforcement.
9. Unit economics trend monitoring and next-scale decision.

## Wave Plan
- Wave 1: config baselines + data contracts + scripts + first reports.
- Wave 2: controlled rollout per zone with daily KPI reviews.
- Wave 3: optimization loops (pricing/ranking/growth) with experiment governance.

## Entry Criteria
- Phase 3 signed.
- Daily reconciliation and KPI war room operating.
- On-call escalation path active.

## Exit Criteria
- Phase 4 checklist completed and signed.
- Unit economics trend meets scale threshold for two consecutive review cycles.
