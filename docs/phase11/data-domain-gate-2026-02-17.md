# Phase 11 - Data/Domain Gate Report

Date: 2026-02-17
Owner: Codex

## Scope
- Data integrity (booking/payment/wallet/reconciliation)
- Idempotency and concurrency safety
- Event/audit traceability
- Migration safety

## Evidence
- Unit/integration/e2e suite passed (`@barbergo/api test`, 9 suites / 22 tests)
- Booking state and slot conflict assertions:
  - `apps/api/test/mvp-core.unit.spec.ts`
  - `apps/api/test/customer-journey.e2e.spec.ts`
- Security/reliability + RBAC negative path assertions:
  - `apps/api/test/security-reliability.spec.ts`
  - `apps/api/test/auth-hardening.spec.ts`
- Profile/settings API contract and tests:
  - `apps/api/test/auth-controller.profile-settings.spec.ts`
  - `docs/api/openapi-v1.yaml` (v1.1)
- Gate execution logs:
  - `artifacts/phase11/quality.log`
  - `artifacts/phase11/migration.log`
  - generated by `scripts/phase11/run-gates.sh all`

## Migration Safety
- Command: `bash scripts/release/check-migration-safety.sh`
- Result: passed (no destructive SQL pattern detected)

## Conclusion
- API/data/domain gate is accepted for current release baseline.
- Continuous runtime evidence (SLO trend, long-window ops data) is tracked separately in reliability gate.
