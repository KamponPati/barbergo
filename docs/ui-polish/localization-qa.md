# Localization QA (Phase 10G)

Last updated: 2026-02-16

## Scope

- TH/EN labels in app shell
- Customer/Partner/Admin role pages
- Public marketing/legal/support pages

## Checks

- TH/EN label parity: pass on critical actions
- Truncation checks in nav/buttons: pass at mobile breakpoints
- Currency/date formatting: aligned with locale and Asia/Bangkok timezone strategy
- Mixed-language regressions in key routes: none critical

## Follow-up

- Add localized legal long-form variants if legal team requests fully translated formal text packs.
